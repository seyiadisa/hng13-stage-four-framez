## Backend

This project utilizes [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for its backend. Supabase provides a robust and scalable infrastructure that handles user authentication, data storage, and other essential backend functionalities.

Key Supabase services used:

- **Supabase Authentication:** For secure user sign-up and login with email and password.
- **Supabase Database:** A PostgreSQL database to store image URLs and user information.
- **Supabase Storage:** To upload and store user images securely.

## Features Implemented

- **User Authentication:** Users can create an account and log in using their email and password. Note that email authentication was turned off for this project to allow for the creation of dummy accounts.
- **Post Upload:** Users can upload text-based posts with optional image attachments, which is stored in Supabase Storage.
- **Followers Count**: Users can follow other users to view their posts in a home feed.
